        <h1>Bootcamp Week 5 (Front End)</h1>
        <p><u><b>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</b></u></p>
        <p>Honestly there wasnâ€™t much that held me back this week. I have really benefitted from being in person. I feel like the content for this week was more difficult. But I was able to knock out 90% of the tasks by Tuesday by keeping head down and plugging away. I really enjoy the freedom of having two days to work on styling and stretch goals. This give me time to further my knowledge of the content without freaking out about our Friday code freeze.</p>
        <p><u><b>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures)?</b></u></p>
        <p>I am starting to get a feel for JSON and data structures. The syntax and application can be a large concept to wrap your head around. I feel like I will do just fine with them after more exposure and practice.</p>

        <p><u><b>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding Bootstrap or Atomic Design?</b></u></p>
        <p>I really like the concept of atomic design. It helps me wrap my head around what is actually grouped together in a webpage. Bootstrap must be sent from the good lord himself. Its working in a way that I can understand much better than CSS. I love the ease and clean look.</p>
